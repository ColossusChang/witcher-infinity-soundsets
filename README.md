# Witcher soundsets for Infinity Engine games.
Soundsets for infinity engine games, featuring characters from the Witcher games.

Created with [EE Soundset Tool][tool].

Compatible with the Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate II, or Icewind Dale, versions 2.6 and later. Possibly also compatible with BGT and EET, but I have not tested.

Disclaimer: I do not own any voices in this repo. The voices are downloaded from the Nexus mod [The Witcher 3 all Voice Clips][voice]. Credit to [mechtank][mt] for extracting them. Credit to CDPR and the original voice actors for creating those voices.
